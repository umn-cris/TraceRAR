TODO:

1. Improve algorithm efficiency:
	a. used a shadow graph to improve breath first search
	

2. Improve graph visualization:
	a. at the end of dep analysis convert Boost graph to Graphvis graph data structure.

3. Debug:
	a) remove confusin of using Vertex and int interchangably.

4. Generate test cases:
	a. original trace file has high queue depth which cause significant overhead to draw its associated dep graph. We need to generate another trace with limited queue depth
